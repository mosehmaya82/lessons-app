# Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types in C#

In this lesson, you'll learn about variables and the most common data types in C#.

A **variable** is a named container used to store data. In C#, you must declare a variable's type before assigning a value to it.

Common data types:
- `int`: Integer numbers
- `string`: Text
- `bool`: True or false
- `double`: Decimal numbers

Hereâ€™s an example that declares and prints several variables:

```cs
int age = 30;
string name = "Alice";
bool isStudent = true;
double height = 1.75;

// Return a multi-line string showing all variable values
$"""
Name: {name}
Age: {age}
Height: {height}
Is Student: {isStudent}
"""
