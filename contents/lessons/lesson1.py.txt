- Dynamic typing  
- Interpreted (no compilation required)  
- Extensive standard library and third-party packages  
- Cross-platform and beginner-friendly  

Python is commonly used for:

- Web development (e.g., Django, Flask)

## 🧪 Try it out

Let’s test a basic example that returns a message:

```py
greeting = "Python is awesome!"
greeting
```

## 💻 What this would look like in a real Python script

Here’s how the same concept would look in a full Python program:

```py
def main():
    greeting = "Python is awesome!"
    print(greeting)

main()
```

This script defines a `main()` function, assigns a value to `greeting`, and prints it using `print()`.

🎯 Summary:

Python is beginner-friendly, versatile, and powerful. It's used by individuals and companies around the world to build everything from small scripts to large-scale systems.

Let’s continue to variables and data types in the next lesson!
