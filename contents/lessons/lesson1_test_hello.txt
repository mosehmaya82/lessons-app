Lesson 1: Hello World (Roslyn Test)

This is your first lesson using Roslyn scripting.

The following line of code returns a string value and will trigger the ▶️ Run Example button.

Try running the example below:

```cs
"Hello from Roslyn!"
```

When you click the ▶️ Run Example button, the result should appear in the output box below the lesson.

✅ This expression works because it evaluates to a string value — no methods, no voids, no syntax issues.

Later, we’ll move on to variables, functions, and more advanced snippets.
