Lesson 1: Hello World in C# (Roslyn Scripting)

Welcome to your first C# lesson using Roslyn scripting!

This environment runs small C# code snippets and shows their output immediately.

---

## 👋 Hello World

Let's start with the most basic and classic example:

## 👋 Hello World

Here's a simple snippet that returns a message:

```cs
var msg = "Hello, World!";
msg
```

Click the ▶️ Run Example button to evaluate the code and see the output below.

## ℹ️ Why it works

In this learning app, we evaluate *expressions* that return values.

This code returns a string — `"Hello, World!"` — which is captured and shown in the output box.

---

## 🚫 What doesn’t work (yet)

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

This code prints to the console but returns nothing (`void`), so we can’t capture its output here — yet!

Later, we’ll show you how to work with output redirection or more advanced evaluations.

You're doing great! Let's move on to variables and data types next.
