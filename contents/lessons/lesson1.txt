Lesson: What is C#

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
It was designed for building a variety of applications that run on the .NET Framework and .NET Core (now .NET 5/6/7/8).

## 🧠 Key Features of C#

- Simple and powerful syntax  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Strong type safety and memory management  
- Built-in support for asynchronous programming  
- Extensive .NET library ecosystem  

C# is widely used for:

- Windows desktop applications  
- Web applications and APIs  
- Game development (with Unity)  
- Cloud services and enterprise software

## 🧪 Try it out

Let’s test a basic example that returns a message:

```cs
var greeting = "C# is awesome!";
greeting
```

## 💻 What this would look like in a real C# application

Here’s how the same concept would look in a full C# console app:

```cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var greeting = "C# is awesome!";
        Console.WriteLine(greeting);
    }
}
```

This program defines a `Main` method, declares a variable, and prints it using `Console.WriteLine`.

🎯 Summary:

C# is a beginner-friendly but professional-grade language. It’s used by companies and developers worldwide to build everything from desktop apps to massive cloud platforms.

Let’s continue to variables and data types in the next lesson!
