Lesson 1: Introduction to C#

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. 
It is designed to be simple, powerful, and type-safe. C# is primarily used for building Windows desktop applications, 
web apps, cloud-based services, and games using the Unity engine.

Key Features of C#:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Strong type checking
- Automatic garbage collection
- Rich standard library
- Support for asynchronous programming

## Example Code

Click the ▶️ Run Example button below to evaluate this line of code:

```cs
"Hello, World!"
```

This line returns a string, which your app will show in the output box.

---

In a full C# application, you'd write:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

However, this would not produce a result in this app because `Console.WriteLine` returns `void`.

Instead, we use expressions that return values, like `"Hello, World!"`.

C# runs on the .NET platform and is widely used in enterprise and desktop software development.
