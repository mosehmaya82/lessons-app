Lesson 1: Introduction to C#

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. 
It is designed to be simple, powerful, and type-safe. C# is primarily used for building Windows desktop applications, 
web apps, cloud-based services, and games using the Unity engine.

Key Features of C#:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Strong type checking
- Automatic garbage collection
- Rich standard library
- Support for asynchronous programming

## Example Code

The line below returns the string `"Hello, World!"`, just like what you'd print in a console application.

```cs
"Hello, World!"
