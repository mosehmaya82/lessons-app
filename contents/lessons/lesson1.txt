Lesson 1: Introduction to C#

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. 
It is designed to be simple, powerful, and type-safe. C# is primarily used for building Windows desktop applications, 
web apps, cloud-based services, and games using the Unity engine.

Key Features of C#:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Strong type checking
- Automatic garbage collection
- Rich standard library
- Support for asynchronous programming

Example Code:
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This code prints 'Hello, World!' to the console â€” a classic beginner's program in most languages.

C# runs on the .NET platform and is widely used in enterprise and desktop software development.
