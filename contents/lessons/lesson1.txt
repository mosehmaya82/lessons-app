## 🧪 Try it out

Let’s test a basic example that returns a message:

```cs
var greeting = "C# is awesome!";
greeting
```

Click ▶️ Run Example to see the output.

This snippet works because it creates a variable `greeting` with a string and returns it. Roslyn scripting allows evaluating such expressions safely in this environment.

🎯 Summary:

C# is a beginner-friendly but professional-grade language. It’s used by companies and developers worldwide to build everything from desktop apps to massive cloud platforms.

Let’s continue to variables and data types in the next lesson!
